# Extrinsic parameter between IMU and Camera.
estimate_extrinsic: 1   # 0  Have an accurate extrinsic parameters. We will trust the following imu^R_cam, imu^T_cam, don't change it.
                        # 1  Have an initial guess about extrinsic parameters. We will optimize around your initial guess.
                        # 2  Don't know anything about extrinsic parameters. You don't need to give R,T. We will try to calibrate it. Do some rotation movement at beginning. 

# If you choose 1 or 2, the extrinsic calibration result will be written vins_folder_path + ex_calib_result_path.
# If you choose 0 or 1, you should write down the following matrix.
